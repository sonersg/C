Hello everyone, in this course,  you r going to write ur first C program
This course is a great starting point for beginners. I excluded advanced topics and i tried to keep it simple as much as i could so you're alone with the fundamentals of programming but if u wanna discover more and find the individual videos, u can check the C programming Playlist on this YouTube channel

Now i will tell u 
why u need to learn c 

The C language was originated in 1970s.

It is like the grandpa of other languages. 

For example. python is written in C and many other languages were influenced by its syntax.

C is not object-oriented. C++ was developed on top of C as object oriented language.

Learning C helps you understand the fundamentals of programming, memory management, and computer architecture.

C is the language of operating systems.

It is a low level, compiled language.

Provides access to hardware and memory via pointers.
It has low level access and 
this makes C more challenging for beginners but don't get discouraged, u can do it.

low-level languages:
are fast, 
close to machine architecture
and they consume less memory


high-level languages:

are beginner friendly

easier to understand and abstract

on the other hand, high-level languages:
they are slow,
they use more memory,
and difficult to work with low level hardware
